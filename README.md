# CensusChecker

Census data collection function and user request script.

Using a given table of data, CensusTest will collate that data into a nested dictionary. Once the dictionary is set, CensusTest write the data to function that is then calleable.

CensusReport uses that written function to allow for the user to specify which states and counties they would like to see.
